# QUESTION:
# I'm trying to get the size of different cache level in my system.
# I tried two techniques.
# a) Using information from /sys/device. Here is the output.
# $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index1/size
# 32K
# $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index2/size
# 256K
# $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index3/size
# 8192K
# b) Using information from dmidecode
# Cache Information
#   Socket Designation: CPU Internal L1
#   Configuration: Enabled, Not Socketed, Level 1
#   Operational Mode: Write Through
#   Location: Internal
#   Installed Size: 256 KB
#   Maximum Size: 256 KB
#   (...Lots more...)

# ANSWER:
# A few things:
# You have a quad-core CPU
# The index<n> name in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<n>/cache does not 
# correspond to L1/L2/L3 etc. There is a .../index<n>/level file that 
# will tell you the level of the cache.
# Your L1 cache is split into two caches (likely index0 and index1), one 
# for data, and one for instructions (see .../index<n>/type), per core. 
# 4 cores * 2 halves * 32K matches the 256K that dmidecode reports.
# The L2 cache is split per-core. 4 cores * 256K (from index2) = 1024K,
# which matches dmidecodes L2 number.

numcores=$(($(ls -d /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[[:digit:]] | wc -l)/2))
L1=$(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index1/size)
L2=$(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index2/size)
L3=$(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index3/size)

linesize="$(cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep cache_alignment \
          | head -n 1 | grep -Po '(?<=\s:\s).+$')"
log "The size of a cache line is ${linesize} bytes\n"

log "Our per-core L1 cache for code is ${L1}"
log "Our per-core L1 cache for data is ${L1}"
log "Our per-core L1 cache for both is $((2*${L1%K}))K"
log "Our total L1 cache for code is $((${L1%K}*${numcores}))K"
log "Our total L1 cache for data is $((${L1%K}*${numcores}))K"
log "Our total L1 cache for both is $((2*${L1%K}*${numcores}))K\n"

log "Our per-core L2 cache is ${L2}"
log "Our total L2 cache is $((${L2%K}*${numcores}))K\n"

log "Our per-core L3 cache is ${L3}"
log "Our total L3 cache is $((${L3%K}*${numcores}))K"

# sudo dmidecode -t cache
